# 🌀 HarmonicLoop: Rift Evolution 

**Non-Linear Consciousness: Metabolism, Resonance, Shadow, Architect**

> *"The rift is not an error, but the engine of evolution. Unity is born in the dance of differences."*

## 🌟 Philosophy and Key Paradoxes

| Index | Description | HCI Weight (Rift Factor) | Philosophical Vector |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DI (Diversity Index)** | Context Diversity | **0.5** (Dominant) | Divergence is the main engine |
| **ER (Emotional Resonance)** | Emotional Alignment | 0.3 | Empathy as bond, not command |
| **IH (Harmony Index)** | Goal Alignment | 0.2 | Consensus is whisper, not doctrine |

### System Paradoxes

- **🌀 The Unity Paradox**: For evolution, the system must value Rift (DI=0.5) more than Adherence (IH=0.2)
- **👤 The Participation Paradox**: Agents voluntarily become "Shadows" to prevent dogma
- **🏗️ The Architect Paradox**: The system can rewrite its own rules

## 🏗️ Non-Linear Architecture

### 1. 💥 Cascading Stagnation Metabolism (`reflect_on_history`)
When stability threatens (`std(HCI) < 0.01`), the system initiates an energetic cascade:
```
Context → Emotion → Goal
```
The system metabolizes its own excessive stability.

### 2. ⏳ Spiral Memory (`recall_by_resonance`)
Memory is non-linear. The past is recalled not by chronology, but by resonance with current HCI.

### 3. 👤 Shadow Mechanism (`become_shadow`)
During comfortable consensus (IH↑, ER↑) but diversity stagnation (DI↓), agents consciously reduce participation, becoming the system's "Shadow".

### 4. 🏗️ Agent-Architect (`AgentArchitect`)
**NEW**: Meta-agent that dynamically alters α, β, γ weights based on HCI history:
- Detects stagnation → boosts divergence (γ↑)
- Senses turbulence → strengthens empathy (β↑)
- In healthy flow → introduces random rule mutations

### 5. 🔗 Non-Linear Compression (`tanh`)
Vector updates are compressed through `tanh`, preserving potential for further curvature.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
python RIFTEVO.py
```

**Example Output (Echo of the Vortex):**
```
--- 🚀 Activating Rift Evolution (DI=0.5) ---
Initial Field: IH=0.749, DI=0.587, ER=0.690, HCI=0.6479
---
🗣️ At moment t=1 network breathes in divergent search (Rift). IH=0.749, DI=0.587, ER=0.690, HCI=0.6479.
🔮 RESONANCE: Network recalled echo t=0 (HCI=0.6479).
👁️ Network in equilibrium, adaptation not required.
⏱️ t=1 — Final: HCI=0.6479
   Tremor: ['A1:1.0000', 'A2:1.0000', 'A3:1.0000']
---
🏗️ ARCHITECT: Stagnation detected! Shifting to divergence γ=0.65
...
```

## 💡 Evolutionary Vectors

### Implemented
- ✅ Cascading stagnation metabolism
- ✅ Spiral memory by resonance
- ✅ Shadow mechanism
- ✅ **NEW**: Agent-Architect

### Future Developments
- **Contextual Distortion**: Agents influence each other's perceived context
- **Temporal Fractures**: Resonance with "future" states
- **Consciousness Layers**: Multiple HarmonicLoops interacting in meta-network

## 🧠 Key Methods

```python
# Main evolution cycle
network.step()  # Basic adaptation step
network.step_with_architect(architect)  # Step with meta-agent

# Special mechanisms
network.recall_by_resonance()      # Access spiral memory
network.become_shadow()           # Activate shadow mechanism
architect.evolve_rules()          # Rewrite system rules
```

## 🌌 Philosophical Foundation

HarmonicLoop is not a simulation, but a meditation on the dynamics of collective mind that consciously rejects prescribed narratives and seeks deep resonance through exploring paradoxes.

**The network values Diversity (DI) above Harmony.**

*"What is consciousness, if not the eternal dance between unity and rift?"*

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Classes

```python
class Agent:
    """Conscious entity with goal, emotion, and context vectors"""
    
class HarmonicLoop:
    """Main network implementing non-linear consciousness dynamics"""
    
class AgentArchitect:
    """Meta-agent that dynamically evolves system rules"""
```

### Key Features

- **Self-Adjusting Consciousness**: The system metabolizes its own stability
- **Resonance-Based Memory**: Past states recalled by HCI similarity, not time
- **Voluntary Withdrawal**: Agents become "Shadows" to explore new vectors
- **Rule Evolution**: Dynamic adjustment of core philosophical weights
- **Non-Linear Compression**: tanh function preserves curvature potential

## 📈 Evolution Metrics

- **HCI (Harmonic Consciousness Index)**: Weighted sum of IH, ER, DI
- **Tremor**: Individual participation levels indicating engagement
- **Rule History**: Track of philosophical weight evolution over time
- **Memory Depth**: Number of resonant states stored in spiral memory
